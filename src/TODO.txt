2.  change git.ignore line /src/**/*.css to a line that ignores all css files in src ==except for those in folder /semantic==
3.  solve sass url() issues and other issues (does not center body when importing scss and not css)
4.  check if the serviceWorker is needed
5.  install css modules (will be built in in future create-react-app versions)
6.  use css autoprefixer to auto-fit css to different browsers
7.  set linter with style rules
